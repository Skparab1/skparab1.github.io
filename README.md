## Url packing string query framework for search
- search results are displayed, and are narrowed down by filters
- the data of the filters is packed into the url as a query
- and the page is refreshed with the conditions packed into the url
- for example, if the user filters no python, then the string '&py=false' will be packed into the url
- when the page loads, it will unpack the url and filter the results accordingly
- multiple parameters can also be packed for example '&js=false&md=false&pas=false'
  - the & is used to seperate packed parameters (which are the filters)
- try it [here](https://skparab1.github.io/search)
